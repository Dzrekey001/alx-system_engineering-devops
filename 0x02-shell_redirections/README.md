**Shell Input and Output Redirection**
***
Shell input and output redirection allows users to redirect the input or output of a command from the keyboard or screen to a file or vice versa. 
This is useful when we want to store the output of a command in a file or provide input to a command from a file.

***
**Redirection Operators**

There are two redirection operators in shell scripting:

**>**: This operator is used to redirect the output of a command to a file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
 If it does not exist, a new file will be created.

Example: ls -l > file.txt will redirect the output of the ls -l command to a file named file.txt.
***

**>>**: This operator is used to append the output of a command to the end of a file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.

Example: ls -l >> file.txt will append the output of the ls -l command to a file named file.txt.
***
**<:**  iss operator is used to redirect the input of a command from a file.

Example: sort < file.txt will sort the contents of file.txt.
***
**<<**: This operator is used to redirect input to a command from a string.

Example: grep 'Hello' << EOF will search for the string 'Hello' in the input until the EOF (end of file) marker is encountered.
***
**Usage**

To redirect the input or output of a command, simply add the appropriate redirection operator followed by the name of the file to redirect to. 
For example:

**ls -l > file.txt** will redirect the output of ls -l to a file named file.txt.

**sort < file.txt** will sort the contents of file.txt.

**grep 'Hello' << EOF** will search for the string 'Hello' in the input until the EOF marker is encountered.

***
To redirect the output of a command to the screen, use /dev/tty. For example:

**ls -l > /dev/tty** will display the output of ls -l on the screen.

***
**Conclusion**

Shell input and output redirection is a powerful feature of shell scripting that allows users to redirect the input or output of a command from the keyboard or screen to a file or vice versa. 
This can be used to store the output of a command in a file or provide input to a command from a file, among other things.
