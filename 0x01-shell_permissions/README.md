**Shell Permissions**

***
Shell permissions determine who can access and modify files and directories in a Unix-based operating system. 
This README will cover the basics of shell permissions, including how to view and modify permissions.

**Viewing Permissions**

You can view the permissions of a file or directory using the ls -l command in the terminal. 
The output will show a list of permissions for the file or directory, including the owner, group, and other permissions.

The permissions are represented by 10 characters, broken up into 4 sections:

1. The first character represents the file type (e.g., - for a regular file, d for a directory).
2. The next 3 characters represent the owner permissions (read, write, execute).
3. The next 3 characters represent the group permissions (read, write, execute).
4. The last 3 characters represent the other permissions (read, write, execute).

**Conclusion**

Understanding shell permissions is important for managing and securing files and directories on a Unix-based operating system.
With the ls and chmod commands, you can view and modify permissions as needed.
